### 1.2 description

name | type | description
--- | --- | ---
title | `str` | The apps title. This will be visible in the title bar of the window.
debug | `bool` | The flag to declare the debug-state of the app. The app cannot be built if this value is true.
demo | `bool` | The flag to declare the demo-state of the app. If set to `true` only the UI will be loaded, and no connection to CATIA will be established.
revision | `int` | The starting revision for a document. Can be any number or a letter `a-z` or `A-Z`.
restrictions.allow_all_users | `bool` | If set to `true` any user can make changes to the documents properties. If set to `false` only those users from the **users.json** file can modify the properties.
restrictions.allow_all_editors | `bool` | If set to `true` any user can make changes to the documents properties. If set to `false` only those users which are declared in the **workspace** file can modify the properties. If no workspace file is found, or no **editors** list-item is inside the workspace file, then this is omitted, and everyone can make changes.
restrictions.allow_unsaved | `bool` | If set to `false` an unsaved document (a document which doesn't have a path yet) cannot be modified.
restrictions.allow_outside_workspace | `bool` | If set to `false` a **workspace** file must be provided somewhere in the folder structure where the document is saved. This also means, that an unsaved document (a document which doesn't have a path yet) cannot be modified.
restrictions.strict_project | `bool` | If set to `true` the project number must be present in the **workspace** file, otherwise the changes to the properties cannot be saved. If no workspace file is found, or no **projects** list-item is inside the workspace file, then this is omitted, and any project number can be written to the documents properties.
restrictions.strict_machine | `bool` | If set to `true` the machine number must be present in the **workspace** file, otherwise the changes to the properties cannot be saved. If no workspace file is found, or no **machine** item is inside the workspace file, then this is omitted, and any machine number can be written to the documents properties. Further, if set to `true`, an existing machine number (a value that is already present in the documents properties) will be overwritten with the value from the workspace file.
restrictions.enable_information | `bool` | If set to `true` the user will see the notifications from the **information.json** file.
verification.require_project | `bool` | If set to `true` the user can't save changes, if the project number is unset.
verification.require_machine | `bool` | If set to `true` the user can't save changes, if the machine number is unset.
verification.require_revision | `bool` | If set to `true` the user can't save changes, if the revision number is unset.
separators.bought | `str` | The separator that is used for the bought nomenclature.
separators.metadata | `str` | The separator that is used to distinguish the metadata from the name of a material.
nomenclature.made | `str` | The nomenclature for made parts or products.
nomenclature.bought | `str` | The nomenclature for bought parts or products.
processes.first | `int` | The index of the first process. Can be 0 or 1.
processes.min | `int` | The minimum amount of processes to display in the UI.
processes.max | `int` | The maximum amount of processes to display in the UI.
tolerances | `List[str]` | A list of available tolerances.
spare_part_level | `List[str]` | A list of available spare part levels.
paths.catia | `str` | The absolute path to the CATIA executables.
paths.material | `str` | The absolute path to the CATMaterial file.
paths.local_dependencies | `str` | The folder where local local_dependencies (python wheel files) for the installer are stored.
paths.release | `str` | The folder where the launcher and the app are released into.
files.app | `str` | The name of the released python app file.
files.launcher | `str` | The name of the release catvbs launcher file.
files.bounding_box_launcher | `str` | The filename of the launcher for the bounding box app (must be stored in the `paths.release` folder).
files.material | `str` | The filename of CATMaterial file.
files.workspace | `str` | The name of the workspace file.
